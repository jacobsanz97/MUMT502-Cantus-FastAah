-Learnt some javascript. MIDI player is hosted on github pages.

-Tested soundfonts. Surikov's soundfont seems to be the winner (and has some inbuilt reverb).

-Midijs.net API doesn't have any options. Only play and stop.
-Read about and tried many players (midijs.net, MidiPlayerJS (has setTempo), rism midi-player, timidity, webaudiofont (has reverb))
-Only 1 of them has both reverb control and tempo control (Midi.js). Terrible documentation, taking forever...seems to have an error?
-None of them have pitch control for a playing file.

-Currently using fraigo javascript player w/ surikov soundfont...just because it has some clear documentation.
-------------------------------------
26/09/19:

-Created a volpiano to midi converter in python.

-Started this journal.

-Trying to find a soundfont library with vowels for monk chant...Not succesful thus far. Could try making own soundfont (each instrument could be monks singing with a different syllable, then do program changes), or loading a VSTI on the website. Neither looks straightforward.
-------------------------------------
04/10/19:

-Ported volpiano2midi to js, using surikov webaudiofont.
-Just need to paste in volpiano, no need for intermediate midi files.
-Added tempo.
-Used "Aaaah" soundfont.
-------------------------------------
11/10/19:

-Lowered volpiano2midi by an octave.
-Setting up cantus environent
-------------------------------------
25/10/20

-Found excellent soundfont
-Web players only deal with pre-rendered soundfonts. Need to somehow convert my soundfont to this format.

-------------------------------------
06/10/20

-learned how to interact with DOM, and how Django works.
-minor setback: accidentally deleted static data, have to set up cantus environment again.
-------------------------------------
-14/10/20
-Setback: template won't update (probably gunicorn)
-Otherwise, written all functions needed to 'plug and play' template when we can solve the issue.
-Found a soundfont synthesiaer in javascript on github, works well. Figuring how to load our soundfont onto it.
