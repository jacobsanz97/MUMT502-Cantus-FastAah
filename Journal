-Learnt some javascript. MIDI player is hosted on github pages.

-Tested soundfonts. Surikov's soundfont seems to be the winner (and has some inbuilt reverb).

-Midijs.net API doesn't have any options. Only play and stop.
-Read about and tried many players (midijs.net, MidiPlayerJS (has setTempo), rism midi-player, timidity, webaudiofont (has reverb))
-Only 1 of them has both reverb control and tempo control (Midi.js). Terrible documentation, taking forever...seems to have an error?
-None of them have pitch control for a playing file.

-Currently using fraigo javascript player w/ surikov soundfont...just because it has some clear documentation.

-Created a volpiano to midi converter in python.

-Started this journal.

-Trying to find a soundfont library with vowels for monk chant...Not succesful thus far. Could try making own soundfont (each instrument could be monks singing with a different syllable, then do program changes), or loading a VSTI on the website. Neither looks straightforward.

-MENTION NSERC X2
